This is the repository for my AI modified Taz 6 Firmware.
The default extruder is the MOAR. 

I used the original downloads.lulzbot.com configuration files to see AI to train it to make changes to Marlin Bugfix 2.1.3 in VSCODE.
I then had the AI import the optized settings I created from testing in a hand built firmware for reference. 
Once it was trained the changes were quick using Claude Sonnet 4 and Chat GPT 5.01.
